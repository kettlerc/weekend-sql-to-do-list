## Description

- I didn't have too many problems with this assignment. At this point, connecting everything (client, server, router, database) makes sense and following the GET, POST, PUT, DELETE pattern is working well. The only issue I really had was getting the class to change on the "completed" button. Using two different ternary operators took care of it though.
- I had hoped to get through some of the stretch goals but unfortunately ran out of time.
